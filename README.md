i have made a data visualisation project on "Eyes on Space" 
🚀 Eyes On Space – Stellar Data Visualization
📌 Overview

Eyes On Space is a data visualization project that helps explore and understand complex astronomical datasets of stars around Earth. The project uses Python and visualization libraries to convert raw stellar data such as temperature, radius, luminosity, and velocity into meaningful graphs and interactive visuals.

This makes space data easier to analyze for students, researchers, and astronomy enthusiasts.

🎯 Objective

The main goal of this project is to:

Simplify complex space datasets

Visualize star properties using graphs and charts

Identify patterns, trends, and relationships between star parameters

Make astronomical data more understandable and interactive

🛰️ Problem Statement

Astronomical datasets contain complex numerical values that are difficult to interpret directly.

Raw data like:

Temperature

Radius

Luminosity

Metallicity

Velocity

needs proper visualization to understand patterns and relationships.

This project solves this problem using Python visualization tools.
